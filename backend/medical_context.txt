Diabetes mellitus is a chronic condition characterized by high blood sugar levels. It occurs when the body either does not produce enough insulin or cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Common symptoms include frequent urination, excessive thirst, and unexplained weight loss.

Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is another common chronic condition. It increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. Lifestyle changes such as reducing salt intake, exercising regularly, and managing stress can help control blood pressure.

Asthma is a respiratory condition marked by spasms in the bronchi of the lungs, causing difficulty in breathing. It is usually connected to allergic reactions or other forms of hypersensitivity. Inhalers and other medications are commonly used for treatment.

Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections. They do not work against viral infections such as the common cold or influenza. Overuse or misuse of antibiotics can lead to antibiotic resistance.

A healthy diet, regular exercise, and preventive healthcare are essential for maintaining overall well-being. Vaccinations play a crucial role in preventing infectious diseases like measles, polio, and COVID-19.

Always consult a qualified healthcare provider for diagnosis and treatment of any medical condition.
